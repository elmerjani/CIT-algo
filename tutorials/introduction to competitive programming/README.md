# Introduction to competitive programming

Competitive programming is a mind sport that involves solving well-defined computational
problems within a specified time limit using programming skills.

## Nature of the activity:

- Participants write computer programs to solve given problems
- Solutions are judged based on correctness, efficiency, and adherence to time/memory constraints

## Key aspects:

- Problem-solving: Requires strong analytical and algorithmic thinking
- Time pressure: Contests typically last a few hours
- Efficiency: Solutions must be optimized for speed and resource usage

## Common types of problems:

- Data structures and Algorithms
- Mathematical challenges
- String processing
- Graph theory

## Platforms and contests:

- Online platforms: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [CSES](https://cses.fi/)
- Major competitions: ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup
- Local Contests: MNPC , JNJD (INPT),IT HOLIC (ENSIAS) ,CODE IT (EHTP) ...

## Skills developed:

- Algorithm design and implementation
- Efficient coding practices
- Debugging under pressure
- Time management

## Career benefits:

- Highly valued by tech companies for hiring
- Improves problem-solving and coding speed
- Enhances understanding of computer science fundamentals
